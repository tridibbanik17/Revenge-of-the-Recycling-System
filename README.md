## About The Project

This Python program simulates a recycling system using a Q-Arm and a Q-Bot within the Quanser Interactive Labs environment. The Q-Arm sorts containers based on their mass, material, and destination, while the Q-Bot transports and deposits them into designated recycling bins. The system operates in cycles, with the Q-Arm loading containers onto the Q-Bot until its hopper is full or a different type of container is detected. The Q-Bot then follows a yellow line to the appropriate bin and deposits the containers.

### Key Features

- **Automated Sorting:** The Q-Arm automatically sorts containers based on predefined criteria.
- **Autonomous Navigation:** The Q-Bot autonomously navigates using IR sensors to follow a yellow line.
- **Color-Based Bin Identification:** The Q-Bot uses color sensors to identify the correct recycling bin.
- **Simulated Environment:** The system operates within the Quanser Interactive Labs virtual environment.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Allows customization of servo table angles, bin configurations, and robot speeds.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/721b7fb3-e480-4809-9023-fd48b82b1f8c)

The project utilizes the `Common.simulation_project_library` to interface with the Quanser Interactive Labs environment. The `main.py` script orchestrates the interaction between the Q-Arm, servo table, and Q-Bot.

- **Q-Arm:** Responsible for picking and placing containers based on their attributes.
- **Servo Table:** Dispenses containers for the Q-Arm to process.
- **Q-Bot:** Transports containers to the appropriate recycling bins using line following and color sensing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Quanser Interactive Labs
- `Common.simulation_project_library` (Ensure this is in the parent directory as indicated by `sys.path.append('../')`)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tridibbanik17/revenge-of-the-recycling-system.git
   cd revenge-of-the-recycling-system
   ```
2.  Ensure that the `Common.simulation_project_library` is accessible in the parent directory.
3.  Configure the `ip_address` and `project_identifier` variables in `main.py` to match your Quanser Interactive Labs setup.
4.  Adjust servo table and bin configurations in `main.py` as needed.
5.  Run the `main.py` script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
