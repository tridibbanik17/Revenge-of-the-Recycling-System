### This Python program controls a Q-Arm to sort various containers differentiated by their masses, build materials and container's destination. 

### The program also controls the Q-bot to follow a specific yellow line detected by IR sensors mounted on the Q-bot 
### and dump the previously picked containers into one of four recycling bins differentiated by the bin colours (red, green, blue, and white). 

### The colour sensors mounted on the Q-bot detect the correct bin. 

### After dumping is completed, the Q-bot returns to the home position and a new cycle of sorting and recycling begins.

### An infinite number of cycles will run unless the user terminates the program. 

### Quanser Interactive Labs software powers the simulated virtual environment.
